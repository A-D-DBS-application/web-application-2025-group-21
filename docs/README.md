Extra info:
    IConsult is a smart matchmaking platform designed to connect freelance consultants with companies. Consultants can create a profile, upload their CV, list their skills, and browse relevant job posts. The application utilizes an intelligent matching algorithm, based on skills, search relevance, recency, and popularity, to ensure the best fit. Conversely, companies can use the same system to find the ideal consultant. To ensure privacy and quality connections, contact information remains hidden until a user chooses to unlock a profile, allowing collaboration to begin.
